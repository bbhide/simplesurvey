has been waiting on the edge of their seats for the <a href="http://pressgr.am/" target="_blank">Pressgram app</a> to be accepted in the app store and today it finally happened. Billed as &#8220;An Image Sharing App Built for an Independent Web&#8221;, Pressgram has received some major <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/toyota/2013/08/19/entrepreneur-develops-new-way-to-share-images-online/" title="Pressgram on Forbes" target="_blank">national attention</a>, given its direct confrontation of the very unpopular policies of Facebook and Instagram. The project was fully funded on <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tentblogger/pressgram-an-image-sharing-app-built-for-an-indepe" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> within 30 days, due to the support of a community that is passionate about owning their own data with full creative control.<br />\n<span id="more-8801"></span></p>\n<h3>What is Pressgram?</h3>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/11-user-profile-2.png" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/11-user-profile-2.png?resize=281%2C500" alt="11-user-profile-2" class="alignright size-large wp-image-8813" /></a>In case you haven&#8217;t been following, Pressgram is a photo-sharing app for iOS, created by Atlanta-based developer John Saddington. It is similar to Instagram but with a few serious distinctions: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> Powered by WordPress + iOS with Filtered Photos added in</li>\n<li> Users will own their own data &#8211; your content is always yours</li>\n<li> The target users are publishers</li>\n<li> Currently makes use of open source photo filters</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you use the Pressgram app in combination with the Pressgram WordPress plugin, the images are published to your blog through the typical post publishing process and are stored in the WordPress media folder. They are also stored in Amazon&#8217;s cloud storage and delivered to the Pressgram social network from there in order to create a consistent experience for the user within the application.</p>\n<p>For now the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/pressgram/" title="WordPress Pressgram plugin" target="_blank">Pressgram plugin for WordPress</a> simply de-clutters the homepage so that Pressgram posts don&#8217;t get mixed in with your longer-form content. In the future, Saddington plans to add more features based on user feedback and suggestions from the community.</p>\n<h3>An Interview with John Saddington on Community and the Future of Pressgram</h3>\n<p><div id="attachment_8817" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/john-saddington.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/john-saddington.jpg?resize=300%2C300" alt="John Saddington, creator of Pressgram" class="size-medium wp-image-8817" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">John Saddington, creator of Pressgram</p></div>I spoke with John Saddington on the eve of Pressgram&#8217;s launch into the app store. He was intent on building Pressgram, whether anyone was interested in it or not. He felt so strongly about owning his own data that he long ago cancelled his Facebook and Instagram accounts. </p>\n<p>His Kickstarter initiative outlines the many compelling reasons for owning your own data by refusing to &#8220;line the pockets of another&#8217;s purse&#8221;, as he put it. The clear success of the fundraising efforts show that he is not alone in his thinking:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was pleasantly surprised by how many other online publishers really &#8220;got&#8221; my intention and where I was headed with the application. They could see the value of posting images directly to their WordPress blogs and also the philosophical intent. Naturally I&#8217;m happy that it reached its funding goal but I would have still built the application out if I didn&#8217;t and that&#8217;s because I had originally intended on provisioning it on my own device for myself alone.&#8221; </p></blockquote>\n<p>Pressgram also shares the community aspect that you&#8217;ve seen with Instagram and Saddington has already hand-picked a select few who will be offering their time and resources to help moderate, manage and grow the community that is springing up around this app. &#8220;This is so much bigger than just an &#8216;app&#8217;,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a movement of creatives and artists and digital publishers who are rebelling against the unashamed commercial interests.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Why isn&#8217;t there an Android app?</h3>\n<p>Given Instagram&#8217;s massive success after launching in the Android market, I was curious as to why Saddington didn&#8217;t start there first. I asked him how soon he&#8217;d be releasing an Android app. He said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The answer is quite simple &#8211; I know Objective-C programming as I&#8217;ve built a few apps in that environment but I&#8217;ve never built an Android app. And besides, I&#8217;ve only owned iOS-devices so the intent was to first scratch my own itch and then scratch other people&#8217;s if the interest was warranted and big enough. Apparently it&#8217;s quite large as there are a number of Kickstarter backers who are Android users and who are waiting for it to be released! I will have to build out a team though if I&#8217;m going to get to Android and that takes time and money.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Since I am an Android user, I won&#8217;t be able to try it and will be depending on our readers for some initial reviews. </p>\n<h4>Using Pressgram Without WordPress</h4>\n<p><div id="attachment_8821" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/17-edit-image.png" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/17-edit-image.png?resize=281%2C500" alt="Photo filters on the Pressgram app" class="size-large wp-image-8821" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo filters on the Pressgram app are available even without using WordPress</p></div>Not everyone hosts their own blog. In fact, if Pressgram ever hopes to gain mass appeal, there must be an option for using it by itself. This is why Saddington made sure to account for non-WordPress users in his app:</p>\n<blockquote><p>You can use Pressgram without ever connecting it directly to a WordPress blog &#8211; I believe many users will do this as the philosophical nature of not being part of the Facebook network where they monetize every single thing (<a href="http://blog.pressgr.am/soul/" target="_blank">and if they could have your soul they would</a>) that you are and do. Some users will just want to be part of a better social network as well as having the capabilities of filtering photos and sharing them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Saddington left Facebook and Instagram due to the licensing and policies that he did not agree with, but he still wanted to take pictures and add filters to them and wanted others to have the freedoms afforded to self-publishers who are not dependent on social networks. The <a href="http://blog.pressgr.am/">Pressgram blog</a> has been diligently pumping out posts on why any user, whether connected to WordPress or not, should carefully consider forsaking the data-hungry social networks and find a new way to share online. They&#8217;ve been driving a strong campaign for the open web and only time and downloads will tell how successful the app will be.</p>\n<h3>Initial Proprietary License: Possible Open Source Licensing in the Future</h3>\n<p>The Pressgram app is currently free to download and Saddington has confirmed that it will be so forever. So the philosophy behind Pressgram is all about freedom &#8211; for the user and the publisher. But what about the software itself?</p>\n<p>During the final days of the project&#8217;s fundraising campaign, the largest backer of the project withdrew when he learned that it would not be open source:</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>I canceled my pledge for <a href="https://twitter.com/Pressgram">@Pressgram</a> (10k) because project will be proprietary, not OS like I expected. Sorry for misunderstanding.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Matt Mullenweg (@photomatt) <a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt/statuses/321729470346186752">April 9, 2013</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>When I asked John if the project will ever move to an open source license he said that he is willing to consider it. Given his heavy involvement in working with OS in the past, I was curious as to what aspect of the project necessitates a proprietary license. For him it boils down to a matter of workflow and speed in getting the software out the door:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It was simply a personal decision that I made that would allow me to move faster in the way that I develop, engineer, and ship products. But again, this was a deeply personal project that had no intentions of being a publicly-used application at first. No one knew that I was working on it for 6 months (starting in September of 2012)! It was a &#8220;night and weekend&#8221; passion project that has grown into a little monster! In regards to making it OS in the future &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure yet. I can see the validity from both sides being experienced and a big part of open source for a very long time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This brings us to a very interesting question &#8211; should the developer&#8217;s workflow be a factor in the licensing of his project? I guess this is a very personal decision.  My hope is that John will opt for an open source license in the future and receive all the benefits of having contributors. You never know how many developers would be happy to submit bug fixes and new features to a worthy OS project, putting it much further down the road than one developer could ever go by himself.</p>\n<p>Saddington hopes to reclaim lost freedoms for users in offering them a way to publish their photos to their own sites with full ownership. It&#8217;s a very special thing that he chose to use the WordPress platform to help people regain these freedoms. </p>\n<p>However, WordPress wouldn&#8217;t be the fantastic application-building framework that it is today without its open source license. There&#8217;s no getting around that fact. Pressgram is entirely dependent on WordPress in order to deliver photos to the user&#8217;s home on the web. Is there any reason why Pressgram couldn&#8217;t benefit from those same open source principles that have made WordPress a resounding success?</p>\n<p>These are interesting questions to consider. Congrats to Saddington and his team on launching the app today. Pressgram is an amazing example of how WordPress can be used to power a creative application with mass appeal. We&#8217;re likely to see many such apps in the future.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/RWB28xAPVyI" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 05 Sep 2013 14:09:24 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"WPTavern: This Week On WPWeekly – Swiftype";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=8829";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/I50ByMaYXa4/this-week-on-wpweekly-swiftype";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1056:"<p>On this weeks edition of WordPress Weekly, <a href="https://swiftype.com/" title="https://swiftype.com/">Swiftype</a> will be our special guest.

The primary reason given was that they were not ready to put on a high-quality event. Those who have already purchased tickets will be refunded in full, including sponsors.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not often I hear news of a WordCamp event being cancelled. In fact, I asked Andrea Middleton of WordCamp Central if this was the first WordCamp to be cancelled this year and she said yes. I got in touch with TJList to see if he could provide more insight into the cancellation and what lessons if any he learned throughout this whole ordeal so that other WordCamp organizers could avoid the same fate. <span id="more-8799"></span></p>\n<p><strong>I know you outlined that this years event would not be able to meet high expectations that WordCamp attendees are accustomed to. Is there anyway you could share some more information with me that I could share with others that lead to this decision? Was it poor planning, lack of focus, or just not enough time to get things hammered out? Was the foundation helpful at all or were they one of the reasons for not being able to meet expectations? Any lessons learned that you can give other WordCamp organizers to avoid the same fate?</strong></p>\n<p>In previous years, the lead organizer for WordCamp Detroit had experience organizing events. He is working on other things this year. Most of this year&#8217;s team had worked on previous events, but nobody had managed the big picture.The people at the WordPress Foundation responded quickly and were helpful, when we asked. We didn&#8217;t do that enough. </p>\n<div id="attachment_4720" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/20101012-050426.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/20101012-050426.jpg?resize=225%2C300" alt="WordCamp Detroit 2010 Day 2" class="size-medium wp-image-4720" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">WordCamp Detroit 2010 Day 2</p></div>\n<p>When I took on the role of lead organizer, I greatly underestimated the amount of work required and the number of details to be considered. The team was also busy with life and work. The designer who did last year&#8217;s logo and theme was busy with some major projects in his business. I was wrapping up a year-long leadership development program that took a lot of my time. </p>\n<p>We did not have anyone assigned to creating content and updating news. Publicity was limited to a few tweets and a couple of Facebook posts. Speaker applications were left with no response. No work was being done to contact sponsors. If it weren&#8217;t for multi-event sponsors we would not have had any event at all. Despite all that, we had a great initial response when the site went live. We sold nearly 20 tickets and had 18 applications to speak.</p>\n<p>When my course ended and I started breathing again at the end of August, the ladies on the team said, &#8220;<em>We need to talk about this. Can we really pull this off?</em>&#8221; The answer, sadly enough, was &#8220;<em>No. Not without killing ourselves. Not with the level of quality we want to provide.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>My top 5 lessons learned:</strong><br />\n<strong>1. Do your homework! </strong><br />\nRead the helpful hints and suggestions that other WordCamp organizers have so generously left behind. There are a lot of killer resources out there. Use them.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Start early. </strong><br />\nSix months might be enough. Ask us that next summer and see if the answer changes.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Ask for help. </strong><br />\nThen do it again. And again.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Create a detailed project plan. </strong><br />\nEstablish key milestones at the beginning of the process. Date, venue, theme for the conference, theme, website live date, cut-off dates for speaker submissions, etc. will all impact the quality of the event.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Ask, don&#8217;t assume. </strong><br />\nGet commitments from the key organizers and volunteers. What can they realistically deliver? We&#8217;re talking about doing this again in 2014. I&#8217;m starting fresh with number 1 from my list.</p>\n<h2>The Importance Of Strong Leadership</h2>\n<p>Ask anyone who has organized a WordCamp or any large event for that matter and they won&#8217;t tell you it was easy. Putting on these types of events requires strong leadership skills. Being a leader means you get things done, keep tabs on all of the work your organizers are accomplishing, provide a clear direction of tasks needing to be completed, and being an effective communicator. One of the last things TJ mentioned to me that he stressed I share with everyone else was the following:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In all fairness to the other organizers, I was the source of the breakdown for the planning failure. I was unwilling and/or unable to communicate effectively, and I was not open with the rest of the team about my limited availability. Put bluntly, my early failure to lead and provide direction caused the planning to fall so far behind that we could not recover the event.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Despite the event falling apart, I thank TJ for being open and honest about the situation. I hope other WordCamp organizers read this post and get a grasp as to how important being a leader is to facilitate a successful event. With the lessons learned, I can&#8217;t see how WordCamp Detroit 2014 would be anything but a success. </p>\n<p>Back in 2010 during the first ever WordCamp Detroit, I interviewed lead organizer Anthony Montalbano where we briefly chatted about organizing the event. </p>\n<div class="aligncenter"><div id="v-DlTshvAZ-1" class="video-player"><div><img alt="Interview With Anthony Montalbano" src="http://i1.wp.com/videos.videopress.com/DlTshvAZ/wcdetanthonyinterview_dvd.original.jpg?resize=560%2C420" /></div><p class="robots-nocontent">You do not have sufficient <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">freedom levels</a> to view this video.

As a company that specializes in supporting WordPress users in all sorts of situations, I thought it would be great to talk to them about what they are finding in terms of what is causing the most support queries.

Some of you may know me as a word wrangling WordPress writer from WPMU.org, where I spent the last four years writing about everything from WordPress and BuddyPress news to theme and product reviews, tutorials, and everything in between. Today, however, I&#8217;m excited to announce that I have officially moved to the Tavern.<span id="more-8774"></span></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been using WordPress since 2008. For the past several years I have spent my time scouring the web for all the latest WordPress news and innovations. Plain and simple, I love staying on the front lines of WordPress. So when Matt Mullenweg invited me to join Jeffro and the team at the Tavern to report on WordPress news, I couldn&#8217;t say no. I am thrilled at the chance to chronicle WordPress history as it&#8217;s unfolding right now around the web.  </p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also a great privilege to work with Jeffro, the Tavern Keeper, since he&#8217;s been doing this faithfully for ages. We&#8217;re teaming up to bring you the the best and most interesting WordPress news out there. So if you&#8217;ve been a fan of my articles in the past, please make sure to <a href="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/WordpressTavern" title="WPTavern Feed" target="_blank">subscribe here</a>, where you will be able to follow my new adventures at the Tavern. With WordPress powering roughly 20% of the web, there&#8217;s something awesome happening in this community every day and we&#8217;re going to make sure that you know about it. Grab a pint, pull up a chair and let&#8217;s start up some conversations about WordPress.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/MltI6jQxBr4" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 03 Sep 2013 18:52:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"WPTavern: Edit Flow, Jetpack, And MP6";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=8769";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/pOEZyGzfIso/edit-flow-jetpack-and-mp6";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3344:"<p>The following plugins have either been recently updated or have an update pending. I use all three and know a bunch of other people who use them as well. Jetpack 2.4 in combination with Photon is causing problems on certain websites where images are showing at their full size instead of their specified dimensions. Meanwhile, Edit Flow has been acting up for me since upgrading to WordPress 3.6. I just wanted to share my findings on each plugin thus far. <span id="more-8769"></span></p>\n<p><strong>Edit Flow</strong> &#8211; After upgrading to WordPress 3.6, I discovered that I could not preview posts using the custom post status of Pitch. This took me forever to diagnose and figure out but it has something to do with the plugin not generating a revision which is shown as the post preview when the preview button is selected. I have demonstrated this bug to the developers at Automattic who are in control of this plugin and they are currently developing a fix. If you experience this problem with Edit Flow, I suggest you set your <em>Default</em> post status to Draft since the Draft post status works as expected. </p>\n<p><strong>Jetpack 2.4</strong> &#8211; While 2.4 introduced the awesome <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/jetpack-2-4-adds-widget-visibility-module" title="http://www.wptavern.com/jetpack-2-4-adds-widget-visibility-module">Widget Visibility module</a>, it unfortunately caused images on websites to be displayed at their full size which has been determined to be an issue with Photo as outlined in <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/jetpack-update-messes-up-photos?replies=17" title="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/jetpack-update-messes-up-photos?replies=17">this support thread</a>. If you&#8217;re experiencing the same issue after upgrading Jetpack to 2.4, you&#8217;re encouraged to disable Photon until an update is pushed out. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/GearIcon.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/GearIcon.jpg?resize=145%2C150" alt="Gear Icons" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-8770" /></a><strong>MP6 2.0</strong> MP6 2.0 was recently released and I&#8217;ve noticed a number of icons disappear from my menu which have been replaced with default Gear icons. I initially reported this as a bug on the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/mp6-20-replaced-menu-icons-with-gear-icon?replies=1" title="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/mp6-20-replaced-menu-icons-with-gear-icon?replies=1">support forums</a> but after reading the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2013/08/31/mp6-2-0/" title="http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2013/08/31/mp6-2-0/">announcement post</a>, I see this is expected behaviour. Theme and plugin developers are encouraged to generate new menu icons that are compatible with MP6. Utilizing <a href="http://halfelf.org/2013/mp6uccess-tips-and-tricks/" title="http://halfelf.org/2013/mp6uccess-tips-and-tricks/">Mika Epstein&#8217;s post</a> as well as the <a

In 2011, <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/feedback-needed-for-new-widget-context-user-interface" title="http://www.wptavern.com/feedback-needed-for-new-widget-context-user-interface">I shared my thoughts</a> on what I think would work for a widget control interface.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nI’m thinking of a plugin that’s a cross between Widget Logic and Widget Context. This plugin should work on the premise that anytime a widget is added to a sidebar, it’s viewable across the entire site where that sidebar loads. UI is added to the widget screen so that I can easily search or choose from the various template files that make up my theme to decide where the widget will be displayed. By specifically configuring where the widget will be displayed, I’ve also configured where it will not be displayed. I’m not quite sure which user interface would work best for selecting more than one area where the widgets will be displayed, perhaps the check box method that already exists in Widget Context. This is about all I’d need to satisfy my needs. It’s simple, not many options and I think covers the basis for a lot of uses. Now, if Kaspars or users suggested that they wanted rules, or more complex ways of telling their widgets where to show up or hide, I would not complain about having an Advanced tab that showed additional options. But I definitely don’t want that clutter in view as part of the default configuration UI.</p></blockquote>\n<p>What I requested in 2011 is not far from what Widget Visibility offers. Instead of choosing template files within a theme, I can choose between <strong>category, author, tag, date, page</strong> which are theme agnostic and cover the gamut of options I&#8217;d need to hide or show a widget. I&#8217;m glad they didn&#8217;t listen to me when I described the interface. I only wish something this simple would have been added to WordPress a long time ago. What something like Widget Visibility offers is an easy way to make one sidebar serve multiple purposes without needing to create separate sidebars with specific widgets. This opens up a lot more versatility for displaying widgets. While I&#8217;m still excited to see this piece of functionality accessible to a large audience through Jetpack, I can&#8217;t help but think about how much more exciting it would have been to see this as an added feature back in the WordPress 3.0 days. </p>\n<p>Now I can retire the Widget Logic plugin which required me to know WordPress conditional tags in order to control when and where widgets displayed.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/YEL7zT0yzf0" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 30 Aug 2013 17:47:34 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:53:"WordPress.tv: Frederick Townes: Business Optimization";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=21611";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"http://wordpress.tv/2013/08/30/frederick-townes-business-optimization/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:674:"<div id="v-EICJD1L0-1" class="video-player">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/21611/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/21611/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=21611&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/08/30/frederick-townes-business-optimization/"><img alt="Frederick Townes: Business Optimizationation" src="http://videos.videopress.com/EICJD1L0/keynote-business-optimization_std.original.jpg" width="160" height="120" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 30 Aug 2013 11:07:35 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"WordPress.tv";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"WordPress.tv: Mel Choyce: What’s Your Problem, Man?

That is, perform automatic updates without breaking anything to the point where you don&#8217;t even know the software has updated. On the Make WordPress Core blog, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/08/28/core-updates-in-3-7/" title="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/08/28/core-updates-in-3-7/">we find out</a> how this will possibly become a reality with WordPress 3.7. A plugin created by Pento called <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/automatic-updater/" title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/automatic-updater/">Automatic Updater</a> will be used as the framework to provide this functionality. The first step is for the automation of minor releases. For example 3.7 to 3.7.1 would happen automatically. Andrew Nacin outlines a number of tickets that need to be addressed surrounding this functionality. <span id="more-8748"></span></p>\n<p>One of the first comments on that blog post is from Joshua Strebel, CEO of <a href="http://page.ly" title="http://page.ly">Page.ly</a> which is a large managed WordPress hosting service.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Please consider an opt-out constant/mechanism simply for those of us that run multi-tenancy and manage the entire core package from the top down.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Andrew followed up by noting there will be a mechanism to opt out which will not be accessible from the user interface. Instead, it will most likely be a filter or a constant to not only opt-out of upgrades, but also to enable upgrading to major releases as well in case you wanted full-blown automation. However, they are looking for more feedback from hosting companies and are encouraging them to follow the development of this feature. </p>\n<p>Back around September of 2011, I asked whether <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/should-automatic-upgrades-be-opt-in" title="http://www.wptavern.com/should-automatic-upgrades-be-opt-in">Automatic upgrades for WordPress should be opt-in</a>? Out of 210 votes, 67% or 141 said yes while 69 voted no. At the time, I felt like WordPress wanted to hold my hand too much when it came to managing my install. However, I am completely fine with automatic upgrades to minor releases leaving me to upgrade to major versions when I feel comfortable doing so. The <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/should-automatic-upgrades-be-opt-in#comments" title="http://www.wptavern.com/should-automatic-upgrades-be-opt-in#comments">conversation in the comments</a> following the poll are worth a read, even if the conversation was two years ago. It would be interesting to hear from those who participated in that conversation to see if their views have changed, especially since we now know that the default upgrade functionality will be for minor releases. </p>\n<blockquote><p>I’m just thinking you might want to consider more than the most obvious point of view about upgrades. When was the last time you upgraded Chrome? Did you know it upgraded itself, about twice a week? Did you notice? Did you care? That’s the kind of thing I think we should shoot for. You shouldn’t notice upgrades, they should just happen. And not fail, of course. &#8211; <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/should-automatic-upgrades-be-opt-in#comment-12763" title="http://www.wptavern.com/should-automatic-upgrades-be-opt-in#comment-12763">Otto</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Hmm, Otto mentioned the way Chrome upgrades in 2011, Matt talks about it as the model for WordPress in 2013 and that&#8217;s the way we&#8217;re headed. Perhaps Otto has a future telling crystal skull?</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/oqbc1vm7NYc" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 30 Aug 2013 05:58:42 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"WPTavern: WordPress Weekly iTunes Subscription Information";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=8741";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:110:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/WUn7j6tszac/wordpress-weekly-itunes-subscription-information";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2024:"<p>Since the creation of WordPress Weekly back in 2008, I&#8217;ve used <a href="http://www.talkshoe.com/tc/34224" title="http://www.talkshoe.com/tc/34224">Talkshoe.com</a> to record the show in front of a live audience.

The plugin is licensed under the GPL and has three different pricing tiers. Single site for $55.00, 2-5 sites for $75.00 and 6-25 sites for $95.00. </p>\n<h2>Description And Review:</h2>\n<p>Leaky Paywall takes a different approach to enticing users to pay for content. Normally, paywalls are hard stops that prevent content from being consumed, or shared for that matter unless you pay up. Some of these paywalls are configured in such a way that not only can humans not consume the content, but neither can search engines. Using leaky paywall, site administrators get to decide which combination of content types can be leaked out. The choices range from <em>pages, posts, articles, and Issues</em>, if you have the <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/creating-a-digital-publication-in-wordpress-with-the-issuem-plugin" title="http://www.wptavern.com/creating-a-digital-publication-in-wordpress-with-the-issuem-plugin">IssueM plugin</a> installed. The biggest difference between this paywall system and others is that content behind the paywall can be crawled by search engines and can also be shared via social media. As long as the number of free posts is 1 or higher, articles being shared across social media will not show the paywall message for new visitors. <span id="more-8496"></span></p>\n<p>Leaky Paywall is cookie based which enables it to work as intended. However, it also means that it&#8217;s as simple as deleting cookies to get around the paywall. When I asked Peter what would site administrators do to protect against people getting behind the paywall by either turning cookies off or deleting them once they&#8217;ve hit the free article limit, this was his response:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Nothing, that&#8217;s the leaky part. It works for the NYTimes because 95% of humans are honest or don&#8217;t want to be bothered with having to &#8220;get around&#8221; the system.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You get to choose how many articles can be viewed for free as well as when the free article cookie expires. </p>\n<div id="attachment_8498" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/LeakyPaywallOptions.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/LeakyPaywallOptions.jpg?resize=500%2C379" alt="Leaky Pay Wall Options" class="size-large wp-image-8498" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Leaky Pay Wall Options</p></div>\n<p>You can configure the subscribe or login message which is the message that will be viewed to those who have reached their free article limit. The message can either use the default CSS style that comes with the plugin or none at all. By default, it will look like this:</p>\n<div id="attachment_8499" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/LeakyPaywallSubscribeCSS.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/LeakyPaywallSubscribeCSS.jpg?resize=500%2C128" alt="Subscribe Box CSS" class="size-large wp-image-8499" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Default CSS</p></div>\n<p>Out of the box, Leaky Paywall only supports the Stripe Payment gateway for recurring payments but there will be more payment processors in the future. </p>\n<h2>Support:</h2>\n<p>There are a couple of different ways of obtaining support. The first is access to <a href="http://issuem.com/forums/" title="http://issuem.com/forums/">basic support forums</a> where registration is free. The second is by purchasing a 1 Month support package for $39 that provides access to the priority support section of the forum with the promise of getting you a response within 8 business hours. The third is a yearly priority support package for $129 that gives you all of the above for a year. There is also <a href="http://issuem.com/category/training/" title="http://issuem.com/category/training/">free access to training material</a> on their training page. </p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts:</h2>\n<p>While I was originally against the idea of Paywalls, something like what Leaky Paywall provides has changed my mind. It&#8217;s not intrusive, the built-in Stripe Payment gateway makes it easy to pay/subscribe to the site without the need for a password and content can still be shared as well as consumed by the outside world without any problems.</p>\n<div class="aligncenter"></div>\n<h2>Coupon Code</h2>\n<p>Readers of WPTavern.com who are interested in purchasing the plugin can use the coupon code <strong>LeakyTavern2013</strong> to receive 50% off the price. There are only 10 available so it&#8217;s first come, first serve. </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/DcgKaMjn1fA" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 29 Aug 2013 11:00:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"WordPress.tv: Brad Parbs: Getting SASSy – Fun with CSS Preprocessors";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=21700";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"http://wordpress.tv/2013/08/29/brad-parbs-getting-sassy-fun-with-css-preprocessors/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:687:"<div id="v-rGnRsjzP-1" class="video-player">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/21700/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/21700/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=21700&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/08/29/brad-parbs-getting-sassy-fun-with-css-preprocessors/"><img alt="Brad Parbs: Getting SASSy – Fun with CSS Preprocessors" src="http://videos.videopress.com/rGnRsjzP/getting-sassy-fun_std.original.jpg" width="160" height="120" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 29 Aug 2013 11:00:06 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"WordPress.tv";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:52:"WPTavern: WP Site Care On WordPress Weekly This Week";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=8730";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:104:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/fLKmSbegUj8/wp-site-care-on-wordpress-weekly-this-week";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1476:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/wpsitecarelogo.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/wpsitecarelogo.jpg?resize=300%2C42" alt="WP Site Care Logo" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8732" /></a>Ryan Sullivan and Rami Abraham of <a href="http://www.wpsitecare.com/" title="http://www.wpsitecare.com/">WPSitecare</a> will be my special guests this week on WordPress Weekly.

the week-end, I received an email from Mollom notifying me that they had discovered a security breach. According to their <a href="http://mollom.com/blog/security-notice-august-2013" title="http://mollom.com/blog/security-notice-august-2013">official blog post</a> on the matter, the breach was discovered on August 21st. Mollom is a service managed by Acquia, a commercial open source software company providing products, services, and technical support for the open source Drupal social publishing system. The service works in a similar fashion to Akismet in that it scans messages such as comments to determine whether or not they are spam. <span id="more-8706"></span></p>\n<blockquote><p>This is an important security notice from the Mollom team. On August 21, we identified a breach of one of our Mollom servers. Our subsequent investigation showed that unauthorized users gained access to Mollom servers and were potentially able to access Mollom data. Today we have closed the security loophole used to gain access and taken measures designed to prevent future breaches.</p>\n<p>Data that may have been compromised includes usernames, account contact information, passwords, Mollom public and private keys, and billing transaction logs. PayPal account information was NOT stored on the affected servers.</p>\n<p>At this time, we have no evidence that any malicious activity took place with customer data. To help assure this continues to be the case, in addition to the measures described above, we have changed all Mollom user account passwords. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Mollom has automatically reset all user account passwords to access the administrative interface. This means you&#8217;ll need to access the <a href="http://mollom.com/user/password" title="http://mollom.com/user/password">following URL</a> in order to reset your password. </p>\n<p>The bottom line is if you signed up to use Mollom free or as a paid customer, you should reset your password and keep a close eye on your financial records, especially if you have or had a paid account even though credit card information was not stored on the affected server. The unauthorized access was <strong>NOT</strong> a direct result of a vulnerability within Drupal. If any additional information is discovered during their investigation, the Mollom team will continue to update the blog post.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/SeNQaf5t6Yo" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 27 Aug 2013 18:45:37 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"Matt: Harder, Slower, Less Secure";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=42965";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"http://ma.tt/2013/08/harder-slower-less-secure/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:352:"<p>Jay Rosen (and Barry Eisler) on the surveillance state&#8217;s efforts <a href="http://pressthink.org/2013/08/to-make-journalism-harder-slower-less-secure/">to make journalism harder, slower, less secure</a>.

The site doesn&#8217;t have a huge variety of images to choose from now but over the course of the next few months, I think that will change. I reached out to Alison Barrett who manages the site to find out about its history and what plans if any she has for the site. <span id="more-8568"></span></p>\n<div id="attachment_8569" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WordPressLights.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WordPressLights.jpg?resize=439%2C275" alt="WordPress Lights by Alison Barrett " class="size-full wp-image-8569" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">WordPress Lights by Alison Barrett</p></div>\n<p><strong>Can you provide a brief history of the domain, considering it existed before you purchased it?</strong></p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know much about the previous owner of the domain. The original site was my main source of desktop wallpapers for a long time, and I had referred dozens of people to it. I was bummed when I learned the site was down. I went searching for the owner, and I didn&#8217;t realize the domain had expired until the whois search turned up empty.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you know of any other sites that have an abundant amount of WordPress desktop wallpapers?</strong></p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t think of any other dedicated WP wallpaper sites off the top of my head, though a Google search might turn up one or two. I didn&#8217;t come across any when I was searching for the creators of the wallpapers on the original site.</p>\n<p>My initial reason for buying the domain was that I felt bad for referring friends to something that wasn&#8217;t even live anymore. Now I&#8217;m enjoying running the site, and I love seeing all the excitement around it. The community&#8217;s response to it is driving me to keep making it even better. I would love to find the creators of the wallpapers from the original site, because there were a lot of gorgeous images up there. I don&#8217;t want to republish them without attribution and permission.</p>\n<p><strong>Any chance of getting this site linked to from the Fan Art section of WordPress.org or having a small dedicated section showing 3-6 wallpapers?</strong></p>\n<p>I hadn&#8217;t thought about getting this site linked under the Fan Art section on .org—that&#8217;s a great idea! I&#8217;ll see what I can do.</p>\n<p><strong>Any chance of adding a ratings system, reviews, or any other social aspects to the images similar to DeviantArt?</strong></p>\n<p>I do plan on implementing a ratings system eventually, though my priority right now is supporting multiple resolutions for each wallpaper (including mobile). I will probably add some sharing tools in the near future as well.</p>\n<p><strong>How can people submit images to the site and how should the submissions be licensed? </strong></p>\n<p>Wallpapers can be submitted through the form on the submit page: <a href="http://wp-wallpaper.com/submit/" title="http://wp-wallpaper.com/submit/">http://wp-wallpaper.com/submit/</a> . Technical requirements are laid out there (and will be updated once I get mobile resolution support in place). Images must be released under the Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike license, as that is what they are distributed under on the site.</p>\n<h2>Oops: After The Launch</h2>\n<p>After this interview was conducted with Alison, I did some research into the history of the domain since she didn&#8217;t know too much about it. I plugged the domain into the Wayback machine and didn&#8217;t see any results. For a site that Alison pointed to over the years for WordPress wallpapers, it stands to reason it would have some history behind it. Just for experimentation, I added an S to the end of the domain so it was <a href="http://wp-wallpapers.com/" title="http://wp-wallpapers.com/">http://wp-wallpapers.com/</a> and while that particular domain has expired, it did show up with quite a few results in the Wayback machine.</p>\n<p>The first record on the internet archive is for <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111017210657/http://wp-wallpapers.com/" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20111017210657/http://wp-wallpapers.com/">October 17th 2011</a>. This entry tells us that WP-Wallpapers.com used the Expose theme from ThemeForest to show off the content of the site. That theme is still available for sale but is not 100% GPL licensed. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WPWallPapers.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WPWallPapers.jpg?resize=500%2C359" alt="WP Wallpapers" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8699" /></a></p>\n<p>The next entry was a WordPress maintenance page. However, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120331034901/http://wp-wallpapers.com/" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20120331034901/http://wp-wallpapers.com/?">On March 31st 2012</a>, the site had a few pages of Wallpapers available. It&#8217;s also during this time that we discover the site was owned and operated by the Envato network. The last working entry is on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130323233732/http://wp-wallpapers.com/" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20130323233732/http://wp-wallpapers.com/">March 23rd, 2013</a> with at least 5 pages worth of wallpaper images. </p>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>So not only has Alison pointed people to the wrong domain over the years, she also purchased the wrong domain. She missed it by one letter. I reached out to Envato to find out what their plans are for the domain:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re always trying to streamline our processes and focus more on the projects that really matter to us, which is why we decided to discontinue WP-Wallpapers.com. But we&#8217;re really happy to see WP-Wallpaper spring up to fill the gap! There are definitely some beautiful, creative WordPress wallpapers around.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Despite everything that&#8217;s happened up to this point with WP-Wallpaper.com, Alison is still excited to see the site grow. </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/3luWcT9hGW8" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 27 Aug 2013 04:45:35 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:54:"WPTavern: My Experience – WordCamp Grand Rapids 2013";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=8635";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:102:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/Tu_vAh6bwrA/my-experience-wordcamp-grand-rapids-2013";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15414:"<h2>Things I Learned About The City</h2>\n<p>This event marks the first time I&#8217;ve visited Grand Rapids, Michigan. I can say without any doubt that Grand Rapids is a beautiful city. I got the impression while being downtown that I was in a large city but it wasn&#8217;t large enough to feel inundated like New York or San Francisco. The skyline has large buildings but you can still see the horizon in some parts of downtown. The city also has a wide river that flows through and around the city which from what I&#8217;ve read, is the origin of the city&#8217;s name. However, I saw the river as wide, shallow, and nothing rapid about it. There is talk in the local community around the idea of placing large boulders back into the river to generate rapids but I&#8217;m unsure of that progress. <span id="more-8635"></span></p>\n<p>The other thing I learned while in Grand Rapids was the number of local breweries in the region. I had the pleasure of eating at two of these breweries. One was called <a href="http://foundersbrewing.com/" title="http://foundersbrewing.com/">Founders</a>, the other was <a href="http://www.grbrewingcompany.com/" title="http://www.grbrewingcompany.com/">Grand Rapids Brewing Company</a>. The food was excellent in both locations and although I didn&#8217;t drink any beer since I&#8217;m not a hoppy kind of guy, the WordCamp attendees I was surrounded by couldn&#8217;t stop raving about some of the beers they tasted at each place. The third place I ate at in which I did try a beer (Brouwerij Lindeman Vlezenbeek, Belgium a raspberry flavored beer) was <a href="http://hopcatgr.com/main/About.aspx" title="http://hopcatgr.com/main/About.aspx">HopCat</a>. A place with something called &#8216;<strong>Crack Fries</strong>&#8216;. These crack fries are considered famous in the area because of the unique blend of spices applied to them. After eating them, you&#8217;ll understand why they have their name.</p>\n<h2>The Event Itself</h2>\n<p>The event was held at the <a href="http://www.gvsu.edu/" title="http://www.gvsu.edu/">DeVos Center on Grand Valley State University’s Pew Campus</a> in downtown Grand Rapids. Out of all the WordCamps I&#8217;ve attended, those that are at some sort of college campus location have gone smoothly. This one was no exception. Although I didn&#8217;t attend very many sessions, I did manage to catch up with quite a few people to talk shop and other interesting things going on in the world of WordPress. At this particular WordCamp, I moderated a panel discussion on the topic of Commercial Themes and Plugins with Pippin Williamson, Adam Pickering, Daniel Espinoza, and Jake Caputo. I think the session went over rather well and we covered a lot of information. The one thing that kept coming up multiple times during the talk was support. It&#8217;s expensive but it&#8217;s also the most valuable and potentially the most vital aspect of any business. We also discussed various methods to handle support as forums are great at the early stage but something like ZenDesk and tickets make sense for larger volumes of support requests. I definitely took some feedback to heart concerning my delivery and approach on stage during the session and if I ever moderate a panel like this again, the second one will be 10 times better than the first. Thanks to Brian Richards, one of the event organizers for giving me the opportunity to moderate the panel.</p>\n<p>The session that opened my eyes was <a href="http://2013.grandrapids.wordcamp.org/session/scoping-projects-a-therapy-session-for-those-who-do-client-work/" title="http://2013.grandrapids.wordcamp.org/session/scoping-projects-a-therapy-session-for-those-who-do-client-work/">Scoping Projects</a> – A Therapy Session For Those Who Do Client Work Lisa Sabin-Wilson. Not so much from the perspective of the consultant but from the perspective of a client, realizing everything the consultant has to go through to get the job done. Her idea of scoping and how important it is to get everything on the table before starting work was key. She also discussed why having assumptions can costs you big bucks, wasted time, and make you look bad in front of the client. There should be 0 assumptions from both parties in a project. As a future client myself, I realized that I could make the process go a lot easier for both parties if I scoped out everything I wanted, every nuance, provided documentation, references for ideas and inspiration, etc. The more information I can provide the consultant about my needs, the better off we&#8217;ll both be. It was a session that I didn&#8217;t think would appeal to me but it was the most eye-opening one I&#8217;ve attended in a long time. It was an interesting experience being in a room full of people and seeing/hearing their reaction when Lisa mentioned that <a href="http://lisasabin-wilson.com/tighten-up-those-terms-and-keep-copies-of-everything-forever/" title="http://lisasabin-wilson.com/tighten-up-those-terms-and-keep-copies-of-everything-forever/">she had been investigated by the FBI</a> and to perform a Google search to read about it. I won&#8217;t spoil it for you, you&#8217;ll just have to read her post. </p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Most of the time during the week-end I was involved in multiple conversations with all sorts of people doing awesome things with WordPress. Overall, it was a fantastic event. The organizers as well as the volunteers should be proud of themselves. I had such a good experience within Grand Rapids that I&#8217;m thinking of taking my wife there to experience more of the city. While contributor day was awesome at WordCamp San Francisco, it was nowhere near as effective at WordCamp Grand Rapids. I think a lot of that has to do with the right people not being in attendance such as core contributors, project managers, etc. With that said, those who did show up to contributor day were working with other people on WordPress or were taking the knowledge and ideas they gained the past two days to improve their own sites or projects. This has me wondering if any other WordCamp will be able to have a contributor day as beneficial as the one held at WordCamp San Francisco 2013? </p>\n\n<a

has been a new post published on the WordPress Events site that <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/events/2013/08/20/organizing-a-non-wordcamp/" title="http://make.wordpress.org/events/2013/08/20/organizing-a-non-wordcamp/">outlines a set of proposed guidelines</a> for non-WordCamp events that are created by previous WordCamp organizers. With at least two previous WordCamp organizers putting on their own events this year outside of the WordCamp name, these guidelines are necessary to make sure both events can coexist peacefully without causing confusion to WordCamp attendees. </p>\n<p>First of all, I commend Andrea Middleton and the WordPress.org Events team for putting the proposal out into the open for discussion. Not too long ago, changes like the ones presented in the proposal would have just happened with no discussion and we&#8217;ve seen in the past that this is a recipe for disaster which ends up causing a rift in the community. So far, the discussion surrounding the guidelines has been calm and level-headed. Even Matt Mullenweg has participated in the conversation. </p>\n<p>The proposed guidelines come across as a bunch of common sense to me. I especially like the fact that videos from non WordCamp events are encouraged to be shared on WordPress.tv as long as they meet the <a href="http://blog.wordpress.tv/submission-guidelines/" title="http://blog.wordpress.tv/submission-guidelines/">submission guidelines</a>. If you are a current, past, or future WordCamp organizer, be sure to give the guidelines a read and weigh in. </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/hTBOFW6LoLo" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 23 Aug 2013 20:22:50 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"WordPress.tv: Christina Elmore: From URL To ISBN: Making Books From Blogs";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=21534";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"http://wordpress.tv/2013/08/23/christina-elmore-from-url-to-isbn-making-books-from-blogs/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:745:"<div id="v-b3mX5BqG-1" class="video-player">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/21534/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/21534/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=21534&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/08/23/christina-elmore-from-url-to-isbn-making-books-from-blogs/"><img alt="Christina Elmore: From URL To ISBN: Making Books From Blogs" src="http://videos.videopress.com/b3mX5BqG/01-christina-elmore-from-url-to-isbn-making-books-from-blogs_scruberthumbnail_0.jpg" width="160" height="120" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 23 Aug 2013 19:43:49 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"WordPress.tv";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:9:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Fri, 06 Sep 2013 05:50:51 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:14:"content-length";s:6:"130100";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Fri, 06 Sep 2013 05:30:17 GMT";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 250";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130503050749";}', 'no');

Here&#8217;s a bit more about some of the new features, which you can also find on the about page in your dashboard after you upgrade.</p>\n<h3>User Features</h3>\n<p><img class="alignright" alt="" src="https://wordpress.org/images/core/3.6/twentythirteen.png" width="300" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>new Twenty Thirteen theme</strong> inspired by modern art puts focus on your content with a colorful, single-column design made for media-rich blogging.</li>\n<li><strong>Revamped Revisions</strong> save every change and the new interface allows you to scroll easily through changes to see line-by-line who changed what and when.</li>\n<li><strong>Post Locking</strong> and <strong>Augmented Autosave</strong> will especially be a boon to sites where more than a single author is working on a post. Each author now has their own autosave stream, which stores things locally as well as on the server (so much harder to lose something) and there&#8217;s an interface for taking over editing of a post, as demonstrated beautifully by our bearded buddies in the video above.</li>\n<li><strong>Built-in HTML5 media player</strong> for native audio and video embeds with no reliance on external services.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Menu Editor</strong> is now much easier to understand and use.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Developer features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A new audio/video API gives you access to metadata like ID3 tags.</li>\n<li>You can now choose HTML5 markup for things like comment and search forms, and comment lists.</li>\n<li>Better filters for how revisions work, so you can store a different amount of history for different post types.</li>\n<li>Tons more <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.6">listed on the Codex</a>, and of course you can always <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=resolution&amp;milestone=3.6">browse the over 700 closed tickets</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Band</h3>\n<p>This release was led by <a href="http://markjaquith.com/">Mark Jaquith</a> and <a href="http://geekreprieve.com/">Aaron Campbell</a>, and included contributions from the following fine folks.

From a discussion between myself and <a href="http://mikelittle.org/">Mike Little</a> about <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/">forking our favorite blogging software</a>, to powering 18% of the web. It&#8217;s been a crazy, exciting, journey, and one that won&#8217;t stop any time soon.</p>\n<p>At ten years, it&#8217;s fun to reflect on our beginnings. We launched WordPress on 27th May 2003, but that wasn&#8217;t inception. Go back far enough, and you can <a href="http://zengun.org/weblog/archives/2001/06/post1958/">read a post by Michel Valdrighi</a> who, frustrated by the self-hosted blogging platforms available, decided to write his own software; &#8220;b2, a PHP+MySQL alternative to Blogger and GreyMatter.&#8221; b2 was easy to install, easy to configure, and easy for developers to extend. Of all the blogging platforms out there, <a href="http://cafelog.com">b2</a> was the right one for me: I could write my content and get it on the web quickly and painlessly.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, however, life gets in the way. In 2002, Michel stopped maintaining b2. Over time, security flaws became apparent and updates were needed and, while the b2 community could write patches and fixes, no one was driving the software forward. We were lucky that Michel decided to release b2 under the GPL; the software may have been abandoned, but we weren&#8217;t without options. A fork was always a possibility. That was where it stood in January 2003, when <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/">I posted about forking b2</a> and <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/#comment-445">Mike responded</a>. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>\n<p>From the very beginning to the present day, I&#8217;ve been impressed by the thought, care, and dedication that WordPress&#8217; developers have demonstrated. Each one has brought his or her unique perspective, each individual has strengthened the whole. It would be impossible to thank each of them here individually, but their achievements speak for themselves. In WordPress 1.2 the new Plugin API made it easy for developers to extend WordPress. In the same release <code>gettext()</code> internationalization opened WordPress up to every language (hat tip: <a href="http://ryan.boren.me/">Ryan Boren</a> for spending hours wrapping strings with gettext). In WordPress 1.5 our Theme system made it possible for WordPress users to quickly change their site&#8217;s design: there was huge resistance to the theme system from the wider community at the time, but can you imagine WordPress without it? Versions 2.7, 2.8, and 2.9 saw improvements that let users install and update their plugins and themes with one click. WordPress has seen a redesign by <a href="http://v2.happycog.com/create/wordpress/?p=design/wordpress/">happycog</a> (2.3) and gone under extensive user testing and redesign (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/edanzico/riding-the-crazyhorse-future-generation-wordpress-presentation">Crazyhorse</a>, Liz Danzico and Jen Mylo, WordPress 2.5). In WordPress 3.0 we merged WordPress MU with WordPress &#8212; a huge job but 100% worth it. And in WordPress 3.5 we revamped the media uploader to make it easier for people to get their images, video, and media online.</p>\n<p>In sticking to our commitment to user experience, we&#8217;ve done a few things that have made us unpopular. The <a href="http://tech.gaeatimes.com/index.php/archive/wordpress-wysiwyg-editor-is-a-disaster/">WYSIWYG editor</a> was hated by many, especially those who felt that if you have a blog you should know HTML. Some developers hated that we stuck with our code, refusing to rewrite, but it&#8217;s always been the users that matter: better a developer lose sleep than a site break for a user. Our code isn&#8217;t always beautiful, after all, when WordPress was created most of us were still learning PHP, but we try to make a flawless experience for users.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not all about developers. WordPress&#8217; strength lies in the diversity of its community. From the start, we wanted a low barrier to entry and we came up with our &#8220;famous 5 minute install&#8221;. This brought on board users from varied technical background: people who didn&#8217;t write code wanted to help make WordPress better. If you couldn&#8217;t write code, it didn&#8217;t matter: you could answer a question in the support forums, write documentation, translate WordPress, or build your friends and family a WordPress website. There is <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/">space in the community</a> for anyone with a passion for WordPress.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been wonderful to see all of the people who have used WordPress to build their home on the internet. Early on <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2004/04/switchers/">we got excited</a> by <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2004/04/more-switchers/">switchers</a>. From a community of tinkerers we grew, as writers such as <a href="http://ma.tt/2004/05/om-malik/">Om Malik</a>, <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2004/05/15/mark-pilgrim-switches/">Mark Pilgrim</a>, and <a href="http://ma.tt/2004/07/mollycom-switches/">Molly Holzschlag</a> made the switch to WordPress. Our commitment to effortless publishing quickly paid off and has continued to do so: <strong>the WordPress 1.2 release saw 822 downloads per day, our latest release, WordPress 3.5, has seen 145,692 per day.</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m continually amazed by what people have built with WordPress. I&#8217;ve seen <a href="http://justintimberlake.com/main/">musicians</a> and <a href="http://ma.tt/2013/01/neil-leifer-on-wordpress/">photographers</a>, magazines such as <a href="http://life.time.com/">Life</a>, <a href="http://boingboing.net/">BoingBoing</a>, and the <a href="http://observer.com/">New York Observer</a>, <a href="http://www.compliance.gov/">government websites</a>, a <a href="http://josephscott.org/archives/2011/05/pressfs-a-wordpress-filesystem/">filesystem</a>, <a href="http://www.ymcanyc.org/association/pages/y-mvp"> mobile applications</a>, and even <a href="http://www.viper007bond.com/2010/06/12/so-apparently-wordpress-can-guide-missiles/">seen WordPress guide missiles</a>.</p>\n<p>As the web evolves, WordPress evolves. Factors outside of our control will always influence WordPress&#8217; development: today it&#8217;s mobile devices and retina display, tomorrow it could be Google Glass or technology not yet conceived. A lot can happen in ten years! As technology changes and advances, WordPress has to change with it while remaining true to its core values: making publishing online easy for everyone. How we rise to these challenges will be what defines WordPress over the coming ten years.</p>\n<p><strong>To celebrate ten years of WordPress, we&#8217;re working on a book about our history.</strong> We&#8217;re carrying out interviews with people who have involved with the community from the very beginning, those who are still around, and those who have left. It&#8217;s a huge project, but we wanted to have something to share with you on the 10th anniversary. To learn about the very early days of WordPress, just after Mike and I forked b2 <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/history/">you can download Chapter 3 right here</a>. We&#8217;ll be releasing the rest of the book serially, so watch out as the story of the last ten years emerges.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, <a href="http://ma.tt/2013/05/dear-wordpress/"> I penned my own letter to WordPress</a> and other community members have been sharing their thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://zed1.com/journalized/archives/2013/01/25/wordpress-a-10-year-journey/">Mike Little on our Ten Year Journey</a>.</li>\n<li>Core contributor Helen Hou-Sandi <a href="http://helen.wordpress.com/2013/05/27/happy-10th-wordpress-and-thanks-from-my-little-family/">wishes WordPress happy birthday</a>.</li>\n<li>Peter Westwood on <a href="http://blog.ftwr.co.uk/archives/2013/05/27/a-decade-gone-more-to-come/">a decade gone</a>.</li>\n<li>Support rep Mika Epstein <a href="http://ipstenu.org/2013/you-me-and-wp/">on her WordPress journey</a>.</li>\n<li>Dougal Campbell <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2013/05/27/instagram-my-wife-suzecampbell-and-i-celebrating-the-wordpress-10th-anniversary-with-bbq-in-our-wordpress-shirts-wp10/">celebrating with his wife, Suze</a>.</li>\n<li>Otto on <a href="http://ottodestruct.com/blog/2013/how-wp-affected-me/">how WordPress affected him</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can see how WordPress&#8217; 10th Anniversary was celebrated all over the world <a href="http://wp10.wordpress.net/">by visiting the wp10 website</a>, according to Meetup we had 4,999 celebrators.</p>\n<p>To finish, I just want to say thank you to everyone: to the developers who write the code, to the designers who make WordPress sing, to the worldwide community translating WordPress into so many languages, to volunteers who answer support questions, to those who make WordPress accessible, to the systems team and the plugin and theme reviewers, to documentation writers, event organisers, evangelists, detractors, supporters and friends.

With hundreds of parties going on today, it&#8217;s more visible than ever just how popular WordPress has become.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you to everyone who has ever contributed to this project: your labors of love made this day possible.</strong></p>\n<p>But today isn&#8217;t just about reflecting on how we got this far (though I thought <a href="http://ma.tt/2013/05/dear-wordpress/">Matt&#8217;s reflection on the first ten years</a> was lovely). We are constantly moving forward. As each release cycle begins and ends (3.6 will be here soon, promise!), we always see an ebb and flow in the contributor pool. Part of ensuring the longevity of WordPress means mentoring new contributors, continually bringing new talent and fresh points of view to our family table.</p>\n<p>I am beyond pleased to announce that this summer we will be mentoring 8 interns, most of them new contributors, through <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013">Google Summer of Code</a> and the <a href="https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen/2013/JuneSeptember">Gnome Outreach Program for Women</a>. Current contributors, who already volunteer their time working on WordPress, will provide the guidance and oversight for a variety of exciting projects  this summer. Here are the people/projects involved in the summer internships:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><strong>Ryan McCue</strong>, </strong>from Australia, working on a JSON-based REST API. Mentors will be Bryan Petty and Eric Mann, with a reviewer assist from Andrew Norcross.</li>\n<li><strong>Kat Hagan</strong>, from the United States, working on a Post by Email plugin to replace the core function. Mentors will be Justin Shreve and George Stephanis, with an assist from Peter Westwood.</li>\n<li><strong>Siobhan Bamber</strong>, from Wales, working on a support (forums, training, documentation) internship. Mentors will be Mika Epstein and Hanni Ross.</li>\n<li><strong>Frederick Ding</strong>, from the United States, working on improving portability. Mentors will be Andrew Nacin and Mike Schroder.</li>\n<li><strong>Sayak Sakar</strong>, from India, working on porting WordPress for WebOS to Firefox OS. Mentor will be Eric Johnson.</li>\n<li><strong>Alex Höreth</strong>, from Germany, working on  adding WordPress native revisions to the theme and plugin code editors. Mentors will be Dominik Schilling and Aaron Campbell, with a reviewer assist from Daniel Bachhuber.</li>\n<li><strong>Mert Yazicioglu</strong>, from Turkey, working on ways to improve our community profiles at profiles.wordpress.org. Mentors will be Scott Reilly and Boone Gorges.</li>\n<li><strong>Daniele Maio</strong>, from Italy, working on a native WordPress app for Blackberry 10. Mentor will be Danilo Ercoli.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Did you notice that our summer cohort is as international as the #wp10 parties going on today? I can only think that this is a good sign.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s always a difficult process to decide which projects to mentor through these programs. There are always more applicants with interesting ideas with whom we&#8217;d like to work than there are opportunities. Luckily, WordPress is a free/libre open source software project, and anyone can begin contributing at any time. Is this the year for you? We&#8217;d love for you to join us as we work toward #wp20. <img src=''http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif'' alt='';)'' class=''wp-smiley'' /> </p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/05/the-next-10-starts-now/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:42:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"WordPress 3.6 Beta 3";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/05/wordpress-3-6-beta-3/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/05/wordpress-3-6-beta-3/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 11 May 2013 03:44:41 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Development";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2584";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:374:"WordPress 3.6 Beta 3 is now available!

This year, we&#8217;re happy to be participating as a mentoring organization with two respected summer internship programs: <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013">Google Summer of Code (GSoC)</a> and the Gnome Outreach Program for Women.</p>\n<h3>Google Summer of Code</h3>\n<p>GSoC is a summer internship program funded by Google specifically for college/university student developers to work on open source coding projects. We have participated in the Google Summer of Code program in the past, and have enjoyed the opportunity to work with students in this way. Some of our best core developers were GSoC students once upon a time!</p>\n<p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013#Mentors">Our mentors</a>, almost 30 talented developers with experience developing WordPress, will provide students with guidance and feedback over the course of the summer, culminating in the release of finished projects at the end of the program if all goes well.</p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the program earn $5,000 for their summer efforts. Interested, or know a college student (newly accepted to college counts, too) who should be? All the information you need about our participation in the program, projects, mentors, and the application process is available on the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013">GSoC 2013 page in the Codex</a>.</p>\n<h3>Gnome Outreach Program for Women</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s not news that women form a low percentage of contributors in most open source projects, and WordPress is no different. We have great women in the contributor community, including some in fairly visible roles, but we still have a lot of work to do to get a representative gender balance on par with our user base.</p>\n<p>The Gnome Outreach Program for Women aims to provide opportunities for women to participate in open source projects, and offers a similar stipend, but there are three key differences between GSoC and Gnome aside from the gender requirement for Gnome.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">The Gnome program allows intern projects in many areas of contribution, not just code. In other words, interns can propose projects like documentation, community management, design, translation, or pretty much any area in which we have people contributing (including code).</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">The Gnome Outreach Program for Women doesn&#8217;t require interns to be college students, though students are definitely welcome to participate. This means that women in all stages of life and career can take the opportunity to try working with open source communities for the summer.</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">We have to help raise the money to pay the interns. Google funds GSoC on its own, and we only have to provide our mentors&#8217; time. Gnome doesn&#8217;t have the same funding, so we need to pitch in to raise the money to cover our interns. If your company is interested in helping with this, please check out the program&#8217;s </span><a style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px" href="https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen#For_Organizations_and_Companies">sponsorship information</a><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px"> and follow the contact instructions to get involved. You can earmark donations to support WordPress interns, or to support the program in general. (Pick us, pick us! <img src=''http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif'' alt='':)'' class=''wp-smiley'' />  )</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The summer installment of the Gnome Outreach Program for Women follows the same schedule and general application format as GSoC, though there are more potential projects since it covers more areas of contribution. Women college students interested in doing a coding project are encouraged to apply for both programs to increase the odds of acceptance. All the information you need about our participation in the program, projects, mentors, and the application process is available on the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Gnome_Summer_Program_for_Women">Gnome Outreach Program for Women page in the Codex</a>.</p>\n<p>The application period just started, and it lasts another week (May 1 for Gnome, May 3 for GSoC), so if you think you qualify and are interested in getting involved, check out the information pages, get in touch, and apply… Good luck!</p>\n<p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013">Google Summer of Code 2013 Information</a><br />\n<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Gnome_Summer_Program_for_Women">Gnome Summer Outreach Program for Women 2013 Information</a></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/summer-mentorship-programs-gsoc-and-gnome/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:4:"href";s:31:"http://wordpress.org/news/feed/";s:3:"rel";s:4:"self";s:4:"type";s:19:"application/rss+xml";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:44:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/";a:2:{s:12:"updatePeriod";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"hourly";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:15:"updateFrequency";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:8:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Fri, 06 Sep 2013 05:50:51 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:23:"text/xml; charset=UTF-8";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:10:"x-pingback";s:36:"http://wordpress.org/news/xmlrpc.php";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Thu, 01 Aug 2013 21:49:34 GMT";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 249";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130503050749";}', 'no');
